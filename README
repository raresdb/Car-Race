About:

    This is an implementation of a Car Race game using the gfx-framework presented in the README inside the folder gfx-framework-master + CarRace.
    My implementation of the game can be found at the path gfx-framework-master + CarRace/src/lab-m1/Tema2.
    To open the project, open the main folder in VisualStudio or use the .sln file in gfx-framework-master + CarRace/build.

Gameplay:

    In this game you will control a car using W,A,S,D to move on a track.
    You cannot leave the track, so you will be limited to moving back and forth on it.
    On the track other cars will move on a pre-established route.
    Whenever a collision happens, you will not be able to move the car in the direction of the obstacle.
    Thus, you will have to back away from the car that you hit in order to be able to move again.
    The finish line passing hasn't been implemented, so in this game you will only move freely on the track and try to avoid the other cars.
